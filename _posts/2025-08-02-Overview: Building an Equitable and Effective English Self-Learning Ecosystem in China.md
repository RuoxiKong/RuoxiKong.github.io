I designed and developed a comprehensive English learning platform, aimed at providing a personalized, adaptive, and highly localized self-directed learning environment for K12 and higher education students in China. This platform integrates modules for vocabulary acquisition, reading comprehension, phrase learning, grammar construction, writing skill development, listening training, and phonics recognition, forming a holistic language learning ecosystem. It is dedicated not only to systematically improving students' English proficiency but also, at a deeper level, to fostering their self-directed learning abilities, critical thinking, and global perspective, thereby genuinely contributing to educational equity in China.<br><br>The platform currently serves approximately 10,000 active users and continuously accumulates rich learning data, having successfully launched and been validated in a niche market within China. We firmly believe that combining cutting-edge technology (such as proprietary adaptive algorithms and Large Language Models) with profound local educational insights can effectively bridge the existing educational resource gap between urban and rural areas, ensuring that every learner has an equitable starting point and access to high-quality, individually tailored learning experiences. These designs aim to harness the immense potential of data-driven innovation in education.<br><br>In pursuing educational equity, we particularly prioritize technological accessibility: To ensure smooth usage for students in remote areas of China with poor internet connectivity or unstable signals, the platform's design incorporates Redis structure and Local Session Storage for each user. This significantly reduces loading times and guarantees seamless operation even in low-bandwidth environments. Furthermore, I have authored a book and workbook on vocabulary memorization, which are slated for future publication and will be distributed free of charge to children in mountainous regions, representing a multi-faceted approach to promoting universal access to educational resources.
