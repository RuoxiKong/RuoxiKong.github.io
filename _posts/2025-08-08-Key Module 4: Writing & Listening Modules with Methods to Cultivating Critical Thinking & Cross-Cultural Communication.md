The Writing and Listening modules are crucial for developing students' higher-order language application skills, critical thinking, and global perspectives. Their design integrates theories such as Scaffolding, Corpus Linguistics applications, and the Integrated Input Hypothesis:<br><br> 1. Writing: From Guidance to Idea Construction<br>      a. Scaffolding for Thought Development: The platform eschews rigid, templated writing instruction, instead adopting a guided approach. By providing structured guiding questions and mind-mapping tools, we offer necessary support for students' Brainstorming, encouraging them to think actively rather than passively imitate.<br>      b. Corpus-Assisted Writing for Authentic Expression & Unique Style: The platform provides a real-time updated corpus covering various domains such as school life, current affairs, social topics, technological development, economic policy, and global events, alongside a selection of functional sentence patterns for students to imitate and use. This encourages Noticing and Imitation, allowing students to learn authentic expressions within real contexts, thereby developing their unique writing style and depth of thought, and fostering Critical Thinking. These rich and continuously updated corpora provide powerful data support for the platform, enabling it to offer students constantly fresh exercises and feedback.<br><br> 2. Listening: Integrated Input & Real-time Content<br>      a. Practice of the Integrated Input Hypothesis: All graded reading materials and daily current events news on the platform are accompanied by high-quality audio, supporting a "Listen-and-Read" mode. This design not only efficiently trains listening skills but also helps learners establish Sound-Symbol Correspondence, providing a dual benefit for vocabulary and language sense development.<br>      b. Real-time Content for Global Awareness: Students receive daily current events news and their accompanying audio. This real-time, globally connected content not only sharpens their listening skills but also encourages continuous engagement with world affairs, broadening their global perspectives. By tracking students' listening comprehension data and content preferences, the system continuously optimizes its recommendation strategies to ensure the effectiveness of input materials.
