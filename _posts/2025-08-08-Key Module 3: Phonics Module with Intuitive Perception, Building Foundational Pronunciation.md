The Phonics module is designed to address the challenges of abstract and tedious traditional phonics learning. Through Embodied Cognition and gamified learning strategies, it helps students intuitively perceive and master pronunciation essentials, laying a solid foundation for English speaking and listening skills.<br><br> 1. Visual Pronunciation Guidance: The platform utilizes rich interactive animations and 3D models to visually demonstrate intricate pronunciation details such as tongue position, lip shape, and airflow. This approach connects abstract phonetic symbols with concrete physical actions, assisting learners in forming accurate muscle memory.<br><br> 2. Gamified Interactive Practice: The module incorporates diverse speech recognition games and pronunciation challenges, allowing students to repeatedly practice in engaging scenarios. The system provides instant feedback, correcting pronunciation errors. This low-pressure, high-engagement learning method effectively boosts students' interest and investment in phonics learning.<br><br> 3. Auditory Discrimination & Imitation Training: Integrating high-quality audio resources, the module features auditory discrimination exercises and listen-and-repeat tasks. This helps students establish correct Sound-Symbol Correspondence, not only teaching them "how to pronounce" but also "how to hear," enhancing their phonetic perception abilities.<br><br> Through these designs, the Phonics module aims to enable students to efficiently and accurately master English pronunciation in a pleasant environment, providing a robust foundation for subsequent listening, speaking, and vocabulary acquisition.
