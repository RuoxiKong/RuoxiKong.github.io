<div style="text-align: justify;">

<p>I’ve always been deeply concerned by a critical problem in China: the profound inequity in educational resources. High-quality learning opportunities are often a luxury, out of reach for those who need them most. I saw too many bright, capable students struggling within the confines of a one-size-fits-all system, where traditional, passive learning models fail to adequately nurture essential competencies like <strong>self-directed learning</strong>, <strong>Self-Regulated Learning</strong>, and <strong>critical thinking</strong>.</p>

<p>This personal observation drove me to a foundational belief: if technology was to be a solution, it couldn't just be a digital textbook. It needed to be an active agent in reshaping the very process of learning itself. To achieve this, I believe one must synthesize three core pillars: <strong>thoughtful learning experience design</strong>, <strong>truly personal data-driven adaptation</strong>, and an unwavering commitment to <strong>real educational equity</strong>.</p>

<h2>My Perspective on Design: The Learner as an Active Architect</h2>
<p>For me, designing a learning experience is an act of profound respect for the learner's intellect and agency. My design philosophy is rooted in the belief that deep, resilient understanding is not transmitted, but constructed. This is why I chose <strong>Constructivism</strong> and <strong>Guided Discovery Learning</strong> as my guiding stars. It means every interactive feature, like the <strong>Embodied Cognition</strong>-based "Magic Knife" microworld, is not a gimmick; it is a carefully crafted environment for intellectual exploration. My role as a designer is not to be a sage on the stage, but a guide on the side—to architect systems that provide the necessary scaffolding for students to build their own knowledge, develop metacognitive skills, and ultimately, become architects of their own learning journey.</p>

<h2>My Perspective on "Data-Driven": The System as a Responsive Partner</h2>
<p>Being "data-driven" is more than just an engineering principle; it's a pedagogical stance. I believe data's most powerful role in education is to make a digital system more responsive, more adaptive, and ultimately, more "human." My approach begins with ensuring the integrity of the data itself, which is why the <strong>Corpus Linguistics</strong> study was a non-negotiable first step. From there, the data pipeline—from the <strong>CAT</strong> assessment to the <strong>ZPD</strong>-based recommendation—is designed to function as a continuous, diagnostic conversation between the learner and the system. The data doesn't just optimize for clicks or completion rates; it allows the platform to listen, to understand where a student is, and to offer precisely the support they need at that moment. </p>

<h2>My Perspective on Equity: Design and Data as Levers for Justice</h2>
<p>Ultimately, my work on design and data is in service of a single, non-negotiable mission: <strong>advancing Educational Equity</strong>. For me, equity is not an afterthought or a separate feature; it is embedded in the thousands of technical and pedagogical decisions that constitute the system. It's in the <strong>localized lexicon</strong>, a direct rejection of the pedagogical inequity of imposing a generic, Western-centric curriculum on Chinese learners. It's in the <strong>adaptive engine</strong>, which is an explicit countermeasure to the one-size-fits-all model that systematically fails learners at the margins. I believe the most profound work in educational equity is done at this architectural level—by designing and building systems that, by their very nature, respect individual context, adapt to individual needs, and work to dismantle, rather than replicate, systemic barriers to learning. </p>

<h2>Realizing the Vision</h2>
<p>The synthesis of these three pillars—Design, Data, and Equity—is tangibly realized in the specific architecture of Wordinow's core modules:</p>
    
<ul>
<li><strong>Vocabulary & Phrases:</strong> This forms the adaptive core. But it's not just about memorization. The foundation is a unique, <strong>culturally-contextualized lexicon</strong> I built through a rigorous <strong>Corpus Linguistics</strong> study. This lexicon, combining over 50 local textbooks with international standards like CEFR and COCA, drives a proprietary algorithm that ensures every word is relevant to the Chinese EFL learner's specific cognitive and curricular path.</li>
<li><strong>Grammar:</strong> My goal was to make abstract rules intuitive. I designed multiple <strong>Interactive Microworlds</strong> where students learn by doing. A prime example is the "Magic Knife" metaphor for count/non-count nouns, a direct application of <strong>Embodied Cognition</strong> theory. This approach, rooted in <strong>Guided Discovery Learning</strong>, allows students to internalize complex rules through virtual experimentation, fostering deep conceptual understanding rather than rote memorization.</li>
<li><strong>Graded Reading:</strong> This module serves as the nexus for skill integration. It leverages <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> to dynamically generate texts that incorporate a learner's newly acquired vocabulary. Crucially, every text is passed through <strong>Readability Models (like Lexile and ATOS)</strong> to ensure it resides within the learner's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). This transforms vocabulary reinforcement into a meaningful practice of reading comprehension, perfectly aligning with <strong>Situated Learning Theory</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Writing & Listening:</strong> These modules are designed to cultivate higher-order skills. The writing section moves beyond templated instruction by using <strong>Corpus-Assisted Scaffolding</strong> to help students develop their own voice. The listening component is integrated throughout the platform, based on an <strong>Integrated Input Hypothesis</strong>, ensuring that learners are constantly immersed in authentic language. The ultimate goal is to foster not just linguistic accuracy, but true <strong>Communicative Competence</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result of this integrated, theory-driven architecture is a platform that has grown into a vibrant community of nearly 10,000 active users. This user base has transformed Wordinow from a product into a powerful <strong>"living laboratory,"</strong> providing the large-scale, longitudinal data necessary for my future work in academic research, product refinement, and iterative development.</p>

<h2>My Future Research Agenda</h2>
<p>Thoughtfully designed technology is one of the most powerful forces for bridging the educational divide. But while ensuring equitable access to technology is the necessary foundation, my work has convinced me that the more critical and complex challenge lies in the <strong>equitable design of instruction</strong>. This is the central question that now drives my intellectual curiosity and future research agenda.</p>
<p>My work with Wordinow is a direct response to this challenge. The entire platform is architected as an ongoing inquiry into three central, interconnected questions, each reflecting one of my core pillars:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Design for the Learning Experience:</strong> How do we translate learning science principles into digital interactions that are not just effective, but genuinely motivating, empowering, and respectful of a learner’s cognitive and emotional state?</li>
<li><strong>Data as a Responsive Partner:</strong> How do we leverage data not merely to optimize metrics, but to build a system that is truly responsive to an individual’s learning journey in a responsible and transparent way?</li>
<li><strong>Equity as the Architectural Foundation:</strong> And fundamentally, how do we ensure that every design choice and every algorithmic decision actively works to dismantle, rather than replicate, the systemic barriers that create educational inequity?</li>
</ol>
    
<p>This commitment to interrogating all three pillars—<strong>Design, Data, and Equity</strong>—informs every decision I make, from building a localized lexicon that respects students' curricular realities to creating instructional strategies for users with varying levels of digital literacy. For me, this synthesis is the true meaning of building a better educational future.</p>

<p>The journey with Wordinow is only just beginning. It carries my convictions and represents my commitment to the future of education. It has ignited a passion for rigorous, systematic inquiry, and a desire to contribute generalizable knowledge to the field. My goal is to ensure that every child, regardless of their location, has the chance to see a wider world, empowered by learning experiences that are as thoughtful, adaptive, and equitable as they are effective.</p>
