<h3>Key Module 3: The Writing & Listening Modules — Cultivating Critical Thinking & Cross-Cultural Communication</h3>

<p>The Writing and Listening modules are crucial for developing students' higher-order language application skills, critical thinking, and global perspectives. Their design integrates theories such as <strong>Scaffolding, Corpus Linguistics applications,</strong> and the <strong>Integrated Input Hypothesis</strong>:</p>

<h4>1. Writing: From Guidance to Idea Construction</h4>
<p><strong>a. Scaffolding for Thought Development:</strong><br>
The platform eschews rigid, templated writing instruction, instead adopting a guided approach. By providing structured guiding questions and mind-mapping tools, we offer necessary support for students' Brainstorming, encouraging them to <strong>think actively rather than passively imitate</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>b. Corpus-Assisted Writing for Authentic Expression & Unique Style:</strong><br>
The platform provides a <strong>real-time updated corpus</strong> covering various domains such as school life, current affairs, social topics, technological development, economic policy, and global events, alongside a selection of functional sentence patterns for students to imitate and use. This encourages <strong>Noticing and Imitation</strong>, allowing students to learn authentic expressions within real contexts, thereby developing their unique writing style and depth of thought, and fostering <strong>Critical Thinking</strong>. These rich and continuously updated corpora provide powerful data support for the platform, enabling it to offer students constantly fresh exercises and feedback.</p>

<h4>2. Listening: Integrated Input & Real-time Content</h4>
<p><strong>a. Practice of the Integrated Input Hypothesis:</strong><br>
All graded reading materials and daily current events news on the platform are accompanied by high-quality audio, supporting a <strong>"Listen-and-Read" mode</strong>. This design not only efficiently trains listening skills but also helps learners establish <strong>Sound-Symbol Correspondence</strong>, providing a dual benefit for vocabulary and language sense development.</p>
<p><strong>b. Real-time Content for Global Awareness:</strong><br>
Students receive daily current events news and their accompanying audio. This real-time, globally connected content not only sharpens their listening skills but also encourages continuous engagement with world affairs, broadening their <strong>global perspectives</strong>. By tracking students' listening comprehension data and content preferences, the system continuously optimizes its recommendation strategies to ensure the effectiveness of input materials.</p>
