<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>My entire design process is deeply rooted in a set of core principles. These are not just abstract ideas; they are the fundamental guidelines that direct the development and iteration of every module. In my previous article, I shared the story behind Wordinow and laid out my four-pillared vision. This article moves from the “why” to the “how,” breaking down the methodology behind each of those pillars.</p>

<h2 id="pillar-1">Pillar 1: Deep Personalization &amp; Educational Equity</h2>

<h3 id="core-motivation">The Core Motivation: Educational Equity, Localization &amp; Innovation</h3>
<p>This is the fundamental motivation for this project. I firmly believe that technology can bridge the significant educational resource gap between urban and rural areas in China. To truly bridge this gap, my approach treats equity as a core design principle, moving beyond simply providing access to ensuring the <strong style="color:#006400;">equitable design of instruction</strong> itself. This principle informs every decision, from the pedagogical content down to the underlying technical architecture.</p>

<p>On the pedagogical level, my approach is rooted in the pragmatic realities of the Chinese education system. This means recognizing that for most students, English is a formal academic subject. Its curriculum must therefore strike a delicate balance: it needs to align with national and school-based standards to meet the demands of high-stakes exams, while also providing comprehensive, effective, and progressive content that fosters genuine communicative competence. To achieve this, I constructed a comprehensive and complementary ecosystem that covers everything: vocabulary, phrases, grammar, reading, writing, and listening, establishing a holistic and systemic learning logic. To ground this ecosystem, I deeply integrate local pedagogical data to build a <strong style="color:#006400;">localized corpus</strong> and an <strong style="color:#006400;">adaptive vocabulary leveling algorithm</strong>. Simultaneously, I leverage innovative technologies like <strong style="color:#006400;">large language models (LLMs)</strong> to seamlessly connect these modules, creating an authentic and vivid learning experience. This design results in an <strong style="color:#006400;">AI-powered</strong> learning system that is both exam-oriented and application-driven, engineered to enhance authentic proficiency.</p>

<h3 id="mechanism">The Mechanism: Human-Centered, Adaptive &amp; Personalized Design</h3>
<p>My design philosophy is that a student’s actions and understanding should be the dominant engine driving their learning process to achieve precise personalization and foster intrinsic motivation. In Wordinow, the learning path is not predetermined; every click and every answer from the student dynamically shapes the subsequent content. This is not a passive system; it is an <strong style="color:#006400;">active listener</strong>. Every click, every answer, every moment of hesitation is captured as a data point that feeds the adaptive engine. By listening and responding, the system hands the “steering wheel” of learning back to the students, allowing them to become the true authors of their educational journey. This principle extends equally to educators. I am committed to simplifying complex technologies, providing teachers with <strong style="color:#006400;">interpretable data insights</strong> and flexible instructional design tools.</p>

<p>The platform’s core capability is to dynamically adjust learning paths based on each student’s real proficiency, progress, and cognitive habits. The system is able to accurately “understand” each learner and deliver content that best fits their <strong style="color:#006400;">Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)</strong>. For instance, in the Vocabulary Module, it is achieved through a four-phase adaptive engine: (1) <strong style="color:#006400;">Dynamic Assessment</strong> via a <strong style="color:#006400;">Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT)</strong> model that accurately pinpoints a user’s knowledge state; (2) <strong style="color:#006400;">Targeted Recommendation</strong> using a ZPD-based algorithm to deliver the most efficient learning content from our specialized lexicon; (3) <strong style="color:#006400;">Gamified Acquisition</strong> where students learn and memorize the recommended vocabulary through a suite of engaging, interactive games designed for practice and initial recall; and (4) <strong style="color:#006400;">Contextual Reinforcement</strong> through reading and comprehension training sessions powered by LLMs to create meaningful practice. This closed data loop is the technical actualization of the personalization philosophy. This means that students are always presented with the next piece of knowledge that will maximize their learning efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="scientific-foundation">The Scientific Foundation: Grounded in Learning &amp; Cognitive Sciences</h3>
<p>My design is deeply informed by insights from educational psychology. I focus on combating the <strong style="color:#006400;">Illusion of Learning</strong> — the phenomenon where students believe they have mastered a concept when they actually have not. To address this, the platform utilizes <strong style="color:#006400;">formative assessment</strong> to continuously update each student’s personal knowledge graph through a process of <strong style="color:#006400;">Dynamic Knowledge Tracing (DKT)</strong>. This isn’t just a list of mastered concepts; it’s a visual, interconnected network that maps out a student’s unique web of understanding, showing both their strengths and the specific connections they need to build next. Furthermore, based on the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve, I designed an intelligent <strong style="color:#006400;">Spaced Repetition System (SRS)</strong> to deliver review content at optimal intervals, helping students combat forgetting and achieve long-term retention.</p>

<h3 id="critical-inquiry">The Commitment: A Spirit of Critical Inquiry</h3>
<p>I also embrace an evidence-based and critical spirit. We recognize that “personalization” is not a panacea and that its effectiveness has boundary conditions. Therefore, the Wordinow platform is intentionally designed as a <strong style="color:#006400;">large-scale experimental testbed</strong>. We are committed to using rigorous <strong style="color:#006400;">A/B testing</strong> to continuously explore and validate under what contexts, and for which learners, personalized interventions provide the most significant value.</p>

<h2 id="pillar-2">Pillar 2: Evidence-Based Engagement &amp; Immersion</h2>

<h3 id="intrinsic-motivation">Fostering Intrinsic Motivation: Situated, Embodied &amp; Gameful Learning</h3>
<p>I believe the most profound knowledge is that which is discovered by the learners themselves. Therefore, I am committed to creating rich, interactive scenarios and PBL sessions that guide students to learn through exploration. For example, in the grammar module, I designed a series of interactive games like the “Magic Knife,” which guides students to explore and discover the rules on their own while “playing.” This is a direct application of <strong style="color:#006400;">embodied cognition</strong> theory, connecting an abstract concept to a virtual, physical action. They are not told the rules; they construct their own understanding of the knowledge through hands-on experience and induction, an experience designed to foster not just content knowledge but also <strong style="color:#006400;">metacognitive skills</strong>.</p>

<p><strong style="color:#006400;">Gamification</strong> is an effective tool for boosting motivation, but it must serve learning itself, not just be for entertainment. My gamification design aims to foster <strong style="color:#006400;">intrinsic motivation</strong> for learning by making necessary but sometimes tedious tasks (like vocabulary review) enjoyable. By embedding practice into well-designed <strong style="color:#006400;">game loops</strong>, it effectively enhances students’ interest and persistence, reduces learning pressure, and makes the process more pleasant and efficient.</p>

<h3 id="extrinsic-motivation">Sustaining Persistence: Extrinsic Motivation Design &amp; Feedback Loops</h3>
<p>Wordinow’s extrinsic motivation design is intentionally multifaceted. Beyond fostering intrinsic motivation through gameful learning, the platform incorporates a robust system of <strong style="color:#006400;">extrinsic motivators</strong>. Features such as daily check-in streaks, progress-based rewards, leaderboards, and detailed <strong style="color:#006400;">performance analytics</strong> serve as tangible feedback mechanisms. The performance analytics report is a critical feature, providing visualizations of current and historical learning time, content mastery, and accuracy curves, along with <strong style="color:#006400;">data-driven pedagogical suggestions</strong> tailored to each student’s learning patterns. These reports are provided to both students and their supervisors, creating a supportive feedback loop that acknowledges effort and makes progress visible, thereby sustaining persistence and engagement.</p>

<h3 id="booster-not-narcotic">The Guiding Principle: “A Booster, Not a Narcotic”</h3>
<p>I am acutely aware that within the unique context of China’s K–12 education system, gamification must be designed with a strong sense of responsibility. My concern is that if a game is too captivating, students might become addicted to the “form” of learning rather than the content itself. This could devalue their regular schoolwork and fail to cultivate genuine self-directed learning habits and values. Therefore, my design principle is to ensure that gamification acts as a <strong style="color:#006400;">booster, not a narcotic</strong>, with the ultimate goal of fostering a sustainable passion for learning that can be transferred to <strong style="color:#006400;">non-gamified contexts</strong>, including their regular schoolwork.</p>

<h2 id="pillar-3">Pillar 3: Pedagogy-Led and AI-Powered</h2>

<h3 id="ai-partner">Our Philosophy: AI as a Mediated Partner in Learning</h3>
<p>In an era where AI is reshaping education, its strengths in <strong style="color:#006400;">content summarization</strong>, <strong style="color:#006400;">data analysis</strong>, and <strong style="color:#006400;">idea generation</strong> are undeniable. My goal is to strategically leverage these strengths, ensuring that AI serves as a stable and efficient engine for content delivery and pedagogical guidance within the product. AI in Wordinow is positioned as a <strong style="color:#006400;">collaborative partner, not an oracle</strong>. Its primary role is to scaffold the learning process by serving as a tool for <strong style="color:#006400;">brainstorming</strong>, <strong style="color:#006400;">information synthesis</strong>, and <strong style="color:#006400;">Socratic-style inquiry</strong>. For example, when a student is struggling with a writing task, the AI is designed not to provide the answer, but to ask guiding questions that stimulate the student’s own thinking, helping them to generate ideas and structure their arguments.</p>

<h3 id="ai-guardrails">Our Guardrails: Mediated AI Interaction &amp; Digital Well-being</h3>
<p>My approach to AI integration is framed by a keen awareness of its risks. Students, particularly non-experts, often (1) struggle to formulate clear questions for AI, and (2) lack the domain knowledge to critically evaluate its outputs. Furthermore, as their values are still developing, they are vulnerable to (3) manipulation by biased or “contaminated” LLMs, (4) the potential for unproductive, game-like addiction to AI interaction, and (5) the risk of developing an over-reliance that erodes their capacity for independent thought. Addressing these challenges requires a system of <strong style="color:#006400;">pedagogical governance</strong>. Wordinow is therefore designed to carefully <strong style="color:#006400;">manage student–AI interactions by restricting the types of questions they can ask and limiting the content AI can generate</strong>, ensuring that the AI’s output is always effective and instructionally sound, thereby cultivating <strong style="color:#006400;">critical thinking</strong> and sound values.</p>

<h2 id="pillar-4">Pillar 4: A Dual-Mode System for School &amp; Home</h2>

<h3 id="dual-modes">The System: Teacher-Led &amp; Student-Directed Modes</h3>
<p>A core principle of Wordinow is <strong style="color:#006400;">flexibility</strong>. Learning is not confined to a single setting; it flows between the structured environment of the classroom and the self-directed space of the home. Therefore, I designed a powerful dual-mode system to bridge these contexts, empowering both educators and learners.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong style="color:#006400;">Teacher-Led Mode (For the Classroom)</strong>: The teacher is the conductor. The platform provides a suite of tools to craft and deliver interactive lessons. Teachers can assign specific modules, launch real-time competitive games for the whole class, or use interactive exercises projected on screen to explain complex concepts. A central <strong style="color:#006400;">dashboard</strong> provides a real-time, bird’s-eye view of class-wide progress and common sticking points, allowing for immediate, targeted intervention and <strong style="color:#006400;">data-informed instruction</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong style="color:#006400;">Student-Directed Mode (For Home and Self-Study)</strong>: Students become the authors of their own learning journey. They follow the <strong style="color:#006400;">codified, adaptive learning flows</strong> described in the personalization section, moving at their own pace. Teachers can still monitor individual student progress through <strong style="color:#006400;">explainable analytics</strong>, identify who needs extra help, and assign <strong style="color:#006400;">targeted practice</strong> to reinforce concepts covered in class.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="cross-context">The Synergy: A Seamless Cross-Context Fit</h3>
<p>These two modes are designed to work in synergy, creating a <strong style="color:#006400;">continuous feedback loop</strong>. The data and insights gathered from students’ self-study at home directly inform the teacher’s lesson planning for the next day. Conversely, the topics and skills introduced in the classroom can be seamlessly extended for <strong style="color:#006400;">personalized practice</strong> at home. This model ensures that learning is a continuous, connected experience, rather than a series of disconnected events.</p>

<h3 id="responsible-revolution">Our Approach to Partnership: A “Responsible Revolution”</h3>
<p>Finally, I believe in a <strong style="color:#006400;">Responsible Revolution</strong>. My strategy is not to replace schools but to offer effective technological and product support when they need it. I deeply understand that schools serve an irreplaceable social function — they are where children interact with their peers, gradually shaping their values within a real collective environment. My goal is to provide good products to schools, collaborating with them on innovation and reform to contribute to the advancement of pedagogy. I will continue to be at the forefront of product innovation, but will advance this change gently, protecting students as we evolve in sync with societal norms and parental understanding.</p>
