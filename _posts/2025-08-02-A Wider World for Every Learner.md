I’ve always been deeply concerned by a critical problem in China: high-quality educational resources are often out of reach for those who need them most. I saw too many students struggling in a one-size-fits-all system, where essential skills like **self-directed learning and critical thinking** weren't being adequately nurtured.

To turn this conviction into action, I built [**Wordinow**](https://wordinow.com) from the ground up. It's more than just a learning tool; it's a complete ecosystem I've meticulously crafted to cover everything from vocabulary to writing. My core design philosophy is to harness the power of **adaptive algorithms** to create a truly **personalized learning path** for every student—making technology adapt to the learner, not the other way around.

What's been incredibly encouraging is seeing WordiNow grow into a vibrant community of nearly **10,000 active users**. This journey has not only validated the product's value but has given me the chance to use real-world data to better understand the core needs of learners, allowing me to continuously refine and improve the experience.

I firmly believe that thoughtfully designed technology is one of the most powerful forces for bridging the educational divide. It can transcend geographical barriers to bring the best learning opportunities to those who need them most.

The journey with Wordinow is only just beginning. It carries my convictions and represents my commitment to the future of education: **to ensure that every child, regardless of their location, has the chance to see a wider world.**
