description: The Vocabulary, Reading, & Phrase Modules â€” An Algorithm-Driven Personalized Learning Loop
---
<div style="text-align: justify;">

<p>The Vocabulary, Reading, and Phrase modules I designed are central to the platform, with their innovative design deeply integrating advanced academic theories such as <strong>Corpus Linguistics, Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT), Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) Theory, Situated Learning Theory, Formative Assessment,</strong> and the <strong>Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve</strong>, providing robust theoretical and technical support for precise personalized learning.</p>

_Key Module 1_

<h4>1. Localized Lexicon Construction: The First Step Towards Educational Equity</h4>
<p>I led and completed the construction of a specialized corpus and vocabulary leveling system specifically for Chinese English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. This corpus integrates vocabulary from over <strong>50 versions of K12 English textbooks</strong> across China, high-frequency words from national college entrance exams, general reference corpora (BNC, COCA), and the CEFR framework. Building on this, I designed and developed a <strong>proprietary weighted-leveling algorithm</strong> that generates a vocabulary grading system highly matched to Chinese learners' cognitive pathways and examination requirements. The core objective of this initiative is to address the disparity between diverse local curricula across China and the unified national college entrance examination, ensuring that all students begin from an equitable starting point, with fair access to vocabulary resources highly aligned with core exam demands. This represents not only technological innovation but also a practical commitment to educational equity.</p>

<h4>2. Three-Phase Adaptive Learning Pathway: Precisely Matching the ZPD</h4>
<p><strong>a. Dynamic Assessment:</strong><br>
My first algorithm is built on the core principle of <strong>Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT)</strong>, capable of dynamically adjusting the difficulty of subsequent vocabulary items based on the learner's real-time response to each item, thereby efficiently and accurately assessing their current vocabulary size. This algorithm rapidly pinpoints a student's true proficiency, avoiding redundant testing.</p>
<p><strong>b. Targeted Recommendation:</strong><br>
Following assessment, my second recommendation algorithm does not simply match the student's grade level. Instead, based on their assessed proficiency and my localized lexicon system, it intelligently recommends core vocabulary items within their <strong>"Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)"</strong> and high-frequency words most needed for their current learning stage. This design challenges the traditional "grade level = proficiency" mindset, crucial for achieving truly personalized and maximized learning efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>c. Contextualized Reinforcement & Graded Reading Training:</strong><br>
To embed newly learned vocabulary within meaningful contexts, I leverage <strong>Large Language Models (LLM)</strong> to dynamically generate rich-themed original short texts. This feature essentially constitutes a highly dynamic <strong>graded reading system</strong>. I integrated text readability analysis models such as the <strong>Lexile Framework and ATOS</strong>, rigorously controlling article difficulty to ensure a strict match with the student's learning level. More importantly, this is not just reading; it is <strong>deep comprehension training</strong>. Each text is paired with comprehension questions I carefully designed to target key skills such as identifying the main idea, extracting specific information, and summarizing content. This not only effectively reinforces vocabulary but also seamlessly upgrades vocabulary learning into authentic reading and comprehension practice, aligning with the principles of Situated Learning Theory.</p>

<h4>3. Formative Assessment & Spaced Repetition: Combating Forgetting, Reinforcing Memory</h4>
<p>In the learning loop design, I place a strong emphasis on <strong>Formative Assessment</strong>. Post-learning tests are used not only for <strong>Dynamic Knowledge Tracing</strong>, continuously updating the learner's personal knowledge graph, but also for accurately assessing their vocabulary size. If a student forgets a previously learned word during a test, the system automatically refreshes the word's status and reincorporates it into the learning plan. Furthermore, based on <strong>Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve</strong> theory, I designed a <strong>Spaced Repetition System (SRS)</strong> that delivers review content at optimal time points through gamified formats to combat forgetting, achieving long-term vocabulary retention and precise assessment. Phrase learning also follows this logic, primarily through gamified and contextualized learning, ensuring efficient memorization.</p>
