description: The Vocabulary, Reading, & Phrase Modules â€” An Algorithm-Driven Personalized Learning Loop
---
<div style="text-align: justify;">

<p>The Vocabulary, Reading, and Phrase modules I designed are central to the platform, with their innovative design deeply integrating advanced academic theories such as <strong>Corpus Linguistics, Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT), Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) Theory, Situated Learning Theory, Formative Assessment,</strong> and the <strong>Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve</strong>, providing robust theoretical and technical support for precise personalized learning.</p>

<h4>1. Localized Lexicon Construction: The First Step Towards Educational Equity</h4>
<p>I led and completed the construction of a specialized corpus and vocabulary leveling system specifically for Chinese English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. This corpus integrates vocabulary from over 50 versions of K12 English textbooks across China, high-frequency words from national college entrance exams, general reference corpora (BNC, COCA), and the CEFR framework. Building on this, I designed and developed a proprietary weighted-leveling algorithm that generates a vocabulary grading system highly matched to Chinese learners' cognitive pathways and examination requirements. The core objective of this initiative is to address the disparity between diverse local curricula across China and the unified national college entrance examination, ensuring that all students begin from an equitable starting point, with fair access to vocabulary resources highly aligned with core exam demands. This represents not only technological innovation but also a practical commitment to educational equity.</p>

<h4>2. The Four-Step Adaptive Learning Loop: Precisely Matching the ZPD</h4>
<p>I designed the core learning experience not as a simple path, but as a dynamic, four-step loop, driven by my proprietary algorithms.</p>

<p><strong>a. Dynamic Assessment:</strong><br>
My first algorithm is built on the core principle of Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT). It is capable of dynamically adjusting the difficulty of subsequent vocabulary items based on the learner's real-time response. This allows it to efficiently and accurately assess their current vocabulary size, rapidly pinpointing a student's true proficiency while avoiding redundant testing.</p>

<p><strong>b. Targeted Recommendation:</strong><br>
Following the assessment, my second algorithm does not simply match the student's grade level. Instead, based on their assessed proficiency and my localized lexicon system, it intelligently recommends core vocabulary items within their "Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)". This challenges the traditional "grade level = proficiency" mindset and ensures maximum learning efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>c. Gamified Acquisition & Memorization:</strong><br>
Once the "highest-value" words are recommended, the crucial next step is the actual acquisition. Instead of rote drilling, I designed a series of engaging, interactive games. Each game is engineered to help students effectively memorize the vocabulary through varied repetition and interaction in a low-pressure, enjoyable environment. This is where the critical initial encoding of the memory takes place, building the foundation for deeper understanding.</p>

<p><strong>d. Contextualized Application & Comprehension Training:</strong><br>
After the initial memorization through games, the final step is to transform this fragile knowledge into robust, applicable understanding. This is where I leverage Large Language Models (LLM) to dynamically generate a short, original text using the newly learned words. This feature constitutes a highly dynamic graded reading system, with difficulty rigorously controlled by models like the Lexile Framework. More importantly, this is deep comprehension training. Each text is paired with questions I designed to target key skills like identifying the main idea and extracting information. This final step seamlessly upgrades memorization into authentic reading and comprehension practice.</p>

<h4>3. Formative Assessment & Spaced Repetition: Combating Forgetting, Reinforcing Memory</h4>
<p>In the learning loop design, I place a strong emphasis on Formative Assessment. Post-learning tests are used not only for Dynamic Knowledge Tracing, continuously updating the learner's personal knowledge graph, but also for accurately assessing their vocabulary size. If a student forgets a previously learned word during a test, the system automatically refreshes the word's status and reincorporates it into the learning plan. Furthermore, based on Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve theory, I designed a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) that delivers review content at optimal time points through gamified formats to combat forgetting, achieving long-term vocabulary retention and precise assessment. Phrase learning also follows this logic, primarily through gamified and contextualized learning, ensuring efficient memorization.</p>
