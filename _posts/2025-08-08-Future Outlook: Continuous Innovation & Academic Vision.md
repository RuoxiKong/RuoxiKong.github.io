The learning platform, building upon its current foundations, is actively exploring future development directions, committed to continuous innovation in the EdTech sector and deep integration with academic research, aiming to contribute significantly to educational equity and learning sciences:<br><br> 1. Deepening Personalization & Adaptivity: We plan to further optimize existing adaptive algorithms and recommendation systems. This involves exploring the incorporation of more learner specific traits (e.g., learning styles, motivation types) and cognitive load theory to achieve deeper user profiling and predictive learning path planning, thereby maximizing learning efficiency and user satisfaction.<br><br> 2. Expanding AI's Thoughtful Application Boundaries: Building on our current philosophy of "AI as a tool," we will prudently investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in more complex learning tasks, such as creative writing, argumentation skill development, and cross-cultural communication simulations. Concurrently, we will continue to address the ethical considerations of LLMs in education, including fairness, bias, privacy protection, and preventing dependency, ensuring that every AI application is subject to strict pedagogical governance and guidance.<br><br> 3. Strengthening Data-Driven Educational Empirical Research: The platform's already accumulated large-scale, multi-dimensional learning data represents an exceptionally valuable research resource. We plan to leverage this data for more rigorous empirical studies, validating the long-term learning effectiveness of various pedagogical approaches, gamified designs, and adaptive strategies, and discovering new learning patterns, particularly within the unique Chinese educational context. For instance, our focus on the veracity of student metacognitive monitoring is a significant direction for future research.<br><br> 4. Fostering Deep Integration of Globalization & Localization: While maintaining our localized strengths, we will explore how to more effectively integrate high-quality global educational resources and concepts to cultivate students' global competitiveness. Through the platform, we aim to build a bridge, enabling Chinese students to better connect with the international community while appreciating their own culture.<br><br> We look forward to establishing closer collaborations with the academic community, to systematize and theorize our practical experiences, collectively advancing EdTech, and contributing to the realization of educational equity worldwide.
