Our platform recognizes that data is at the core of truly personalized education. Through rigorous design, we collect multi-dimensional learning data to construct detailed learning profiles for each student, thereby delivering completely customized content and services. This goes beyond simple AI application; instead, AI is positioned as an enabling tool, consistently serving educational objectives and learner growth.<br><br> 1. Granular Learning Data Collection:<br>      a. Calibration of Learner Self-Assessment: To more accurately understand students' true mastery, the platform designs specific testing mechanisms, including strategically inserting a few "fake words" into vocabulary tests. By analyzing student responses to these distractors, we can help identify instances of overconfidence or "illusions of learning." This is crucial for calibrating adaptive recommendations and underscores our deep interest in educational psychology.<br>      b. Tracking Behavior & Cognitive Processes: We record the response time for each vocabulary item during a student's learning process, as well as differences in response times for words at various mastery levels (e.g., new words, semi-mastered words, mastered words). This data helps us gain insight into students' cognitive processing speed and proficiency. Additionally, we track students' total learning duration, module completion rates, and the upward or downward trends in key learning parameters (e.g., vocabulary size, reading speed) over time.<br>      c. Localized Assessment of True Vocabulary Size: By combining multi-dimensional data (including the aforementioned behavioral data and post-learning test results) with our localized vocabulary grading standards, the platform can precisely and dynamically determine a student's true vocabulary size and overall language proficiency level, rather than relying on a single assessment dimension.<br><br> 2. AI Application Philosophy & Algorithmic Governance:<br>      We firmly believe that Artificial Intelligence is a powerful tool, but its application in education must be cautious, always serving educational principles rather than merely pursuing technological efficiency. Especially for K12 and university students who have not yet fully developed mature values, allowing too much freedom to explore AI might lead to negative consequences, such as over-reliance on AI, a lack of critical thinking, or the development of illusions of learning.<br>      Therefore, our algorithmic design aims to prevent both system over-reliance on AI and student over-reliance on AI. We rigorously govern the scope of AI's authority, positioning it as a tool for auxiliary content generation and contextual support, rather than the primary driver of learning paths or direct provider of answers. Core learning paths, assessment systems, and pedagogical strategies are consistently guided by our educational theories and data analysis. This means students are guided towards active exploration and deep understanding, rather than passively receiving AI's direct output, thereby effectively cultivating their critical thinking and self-directed learning abilities.
