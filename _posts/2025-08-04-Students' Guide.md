<div style="text-align: justify;">

<h3>1) Start Right</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Complete the initial diagnostic to set your starting point.</li>
  <li>Set weekly goals: words mastered, readings finished, writing pieces, review minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2) Your Daily Routine (30–45 minutes)</h3>

<h4>Warm-up (5 minutes)</h4>
<p>Do your scheduled SRS review. No skipping—this keeps learning efficient.</p>

<h4>Focus Task (15–20 minutes)</h4>
<p>Follow the “<strong style="color:#006400;">Next Best Task</strong>” the system recommends for you today.</p>

<h4>Apply (8–12 minutes)</h4>
<p>Use what you learned in a short reading or writing task.</p>

<h4>Wrap-up (2–3 minutes)</h4>
<p>Check today’s progress and note one thing to improve tomorrow.</p>

<h3>3) How to Use Each Module</h3>

<h4>Vocabulary &amp; Reading</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Learn target words first, then read the connected text.</li>
  <li>While reading, answer the prompts and highlight where you found evidence.</li>
  <li>After reading, write one paraphrase and one question about the text.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Grammar via Guided Discovery</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In the interactive tasks, try first, observe feedback, then try again.</li>
  <li>After you figure out the rule, write it in your own words with an example.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Writing with Scaffolds</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use the <strong style="color:#006400;">Socratic prompts</strong> to plan your claim, reasons, and evidence.</li>
  <li>Draft, then revise using the checklist. Compare your work to an exemplar.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4) Make Data Help You</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong style="color:#006400;">Mastery gauge</strong>: steady growth means your pace is right; big ups and downs mean you should slow down and review.</li>
  <li><strong style="color:#006400;">Next Best Task</strong>: do it before anything else; it is selected to give you the most learning right now.</li>
  <li><strong style="color:#006400;">Weekly review</strong>: save one reading, one grammar fix, and one writing piece to show your progress.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5) When to Ask for Help</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You miss the same type of question two days in a row.</li>
  <li>Your reading takes much longer than usual.</li>
  <li>Your writing scores do not improve after revision.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ask your teacher with your <strong style="color:#006400;">evidence</strong>: screenshots of errors, notes, or drafts.</p>
