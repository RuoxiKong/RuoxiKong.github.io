The Vocabulary, Reading, and Phrase modules are central to the platform, with their innovative design deeply integrating advanced academic theories such as Corpus Linguistics, Computerized Adaptive Testing, Zone of Proximal Development Theory, Situated Learning Theory, Formative Assessment, and Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve, providing robust support for precise personalized learning: <br><br> 1. Localized Lexicon Construction: The First Step Towards Educational Equity<br> The platform led and completed the construction of a specialized corpus and vocabulary leveling system specifically for Chinese English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. This corpus integrates vocabulary from over 50 versions of K12 English textbooks across China, high-frequency words from national college entrance exams, general reference corpora (BNC, COCA), and the CEFR framework. Building on this, the platform designed and developed a proprietary weighted-leveling algorithm that generates a vocabulary grading system highly matched to Chinese learners' cognitive pathways and examination requirements. The core objective of this initiative is to address the disparity between diverse local curricula across China and the unified national college entrance examination, ensuring that all students begin from an equitable starting point, with fair access to vocabulary resources highly aligned with core exam demands. This represents not only technological innovation but also a practical commitment to educational equity.<br><br> 2. Three-Phase Adaptive Learning Pathway: Precisely Matching the ZPD<br>      a. Dynamic Assessment: The platform's first algorithm is built on the core principle of Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT), capable of dynamically adjusting the difficulty of subsequent vocabulary items based on the learner's real-time response to each item, thereby efficiently and accurately assessing their current vocabulary size. This algorithm rapidly pinpoints a student's true proficiency, avoiding redundant testing.<br>      b. Targeted Recommendation: Following assessment, the platform's second recommendation algorithm does not simply match the student's grade level. Instead, based on their assessed proficiency and our localized lexicon system, it intelligently recommends core vocabulary items within their "Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)" and high-frequency words most needed for their current learning stage. This design challenges the traditional "grade level = proficiency" mindset, crucial for achieving truly personalized and maximized learning efficiency. We have successfully implemented a system that seamlessly integrates localized corpus construction, dynamic assessment, and ZPD-based precise recommendation, which provides students with a more efficient and accurate personalized vocabulary learning path planning and dynamic content recommendation.<br>      c. Contextualized Reinforcement: To embed newly learned vocabulary within meaningful contexts, the platform leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to dynamically generate rich-themed original short texts (covering topics such as school life, current affairs, economic policy, technological development, social issues, etc.). Simultaneously, the platform integrates text readability analysis models such as the Lexile Framework and ATOS, rigorously controlling article difficulty to ensure a strict match with the student's learning level, preventing content from being either too advanced or too simplistic. This not only effectively reinforces vocabulary but also seamlessly integrates vocabulary learning into authentic reading practice, aligning with the principles of Situated Learning Theory.<br><br> 3. Formative Assessment & Spaced Repetition: Combating Forgetting, Reinforcing Memory<br> The learning loop design places strong emphasis on Formative Assessment. Post-learning tests are used not only for Dynamic Knowledge Tracing, continuously updating the learner's personal knowledge graph, but also for accurately assessing their vocabulary size. If a student forgets a previously learned word during a test, the system automatically refreshes the word's status and reincorporates it into the learning plan. Furthermore, based on Ebbinghaus's Forgetting Curve theory, the platform designed a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) that delivers review content at optimal time points through gamified formats to combat forgetting, achieving long-term vocabulary retention and precise assessment. Phrase learning also follows this logic, primarily through gamified and contextualized learning, ensuring efficient memorization. These functionalities are supported by the platform's extensive user learning data, enabling the system to precisely analyze each student's learning habits, outcomes, and the impact of different learning behaviors, thereby generating customized learning reports and providing targeted support.
